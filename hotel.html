    <h1>Hotel Info</h1>

    <p>
      We have reserved a block at <a target="_blank"
      href="https://goo.gl/maps/nasgKp8RwYQ3fJKN7">The Shore Hotel</a> in
      downtown Santa Monica.
    </p>
    <p><b>
      To book with the special rate, use <a target="_blank" href="
      https://be.synxis.com/?Hotel=52507&Chain=7692&arrive=2023-05-19&depart=2023-05-21&adult=1&child=0&group=051923RYZ">this
      link</a>.
    </b></p>

    <p>
      The dates default to Friday May 19 to Sunday May 21, but you can adjust
      the dates and still get the block rate. The group code is 051923RYZ
      (included in the above link). <b>There are multiple room types
      available</b>; look for the buttons next to the "Garden View with Two
      Double Beds" button.
    </p>

    <p>All rooms are <b>$247 per night</b> including taxes and fees.</p>

    <p><b>You must book by April 19 to get the block rate!</b></p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions or issues booking, you can email or text us
      (<a href="mailto:skyewm@gmail.com">skyewm@gmail.com</a>
      or <a href="mailto:sandyryza@gmail.com">sandyryza@gmail.com</a>). You can
      also call the hotel directly.
    </p>

    <p><i> If you already booked at the Carmel Hotel, we suggest canceling
        (free) and rebooking at the Shore Hotel. It's much nicer, a block away,
        and the same price per room. Apologies for switching up the block! We
        think it'll be worth the hassle.
